	Student from the Cukurova UnÄ±versity 
	studying the Computer Engineering
	Program as 2019 will be my 4th year of
	schooling. Very interested and
	committed to my department and want
	to develop myself in certain career
	paths as a Computer Engineering. My
	goal is to lead myself through
	developing in Programming (C, C++,
	JAVA, C#, Matlab, Android etc.)
	I like to socialize as well as I am an
	extrovert. I am a very active person that
	loves to do activities like sports such as
	basketball and volleyball. I like to go
	hiking and commit to volunteering and
	helping people out as much as possible.
